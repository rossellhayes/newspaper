**newspaper** provides an interface for scraping online news articles, powered by the [*newspaper* Python package](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

You can install the the development version of *newspaper* from [GitHub](https://github.com/rossellhayes/incase) with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("rossellhayes/newspaper")
```

To setup *newspaper*'s Python dependencies, use

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(newspaper)
newspaper_install()
```

## Usage

```{r}
newspaper_scrape("https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-web-scraping")
```

You can specify specific fields if you don't need all the information provided:

```{r}
newspaper_scrape(
  "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-web-scraping",
  fields = c("title", "text")
)
```

*newspaper* will return `NA` values if an article cannot be located:

```{r}
newspaper_scrape("http://invalid.example")
```

or if certain metadata is missing:

```{r}
newspaper_scrape("https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02558-0")
```

You can pass a vector of URLs to scrape multiple articles at once.

```{r}
newspaper_scrape(
  c(
    "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-web-scraping",
    "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02558-0",
    "http://invalid.example"
  )
)
```
